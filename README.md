- On each turn, a player rolls a dice and accumulates points based on the rolled number.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.
- The player can choose to "Hold" their current score, which adds it to their total score.
- The first player to reach a certain score threshold (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
